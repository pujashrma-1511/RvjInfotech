# Write a program to read in names and birth dates from a text file. It should
# then ask you for a name. You type one in, and it tells you when that person’s
# next birthday will be (and, for the truly adventurous, how old they’ll be). The
# input file should look something like this:
# Chris Hemsworth, Aug 11, 1983
# Chris Evans, Jun 13, 1981
# Chris Pratt, Jun 21, 1979
# Chris Pine, Aug 26, 1980
# Other Chris Pine, Aug 3, 1976
